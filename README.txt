Procedures to run the pathway generator for the UV/Free Chlorine process

Step 1: Download and open the Release_Application_UV_Free_Chlorine_Pathway.exe 
 
Step 2: Input the SMILES of target organic compound (e.g. TCE SMILE is C([Cl])([Cl])=C([Cl])) and press Enter
 
Step 3: Input the complexity (1 or 2) and press Enter
 
Step 4: Wait for generating elementary reactions and involved species (radicals and molecules) of the target organic compound destruction in the UV/free chlorine process. The pathway prediction results are stored at output.txt, which is located at the same folder as UV_HOCl_Pathway_Generator.exe.
